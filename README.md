# GAS_DateFunctionsForJapan
This is a date-related library that I created myself and use regularly when working with Google Apps Script.
This script is designed for my use in Japan, and it operates by referencing Japanese holiday information.
If you intend to use it in another country, you will need to change the address referenced by the 'isHoliday' function.

This is my first post and test of GitHub.
